# Web Panel Account Validator

This project automates the login and account validation process for a web panel using Puppeteer (Node.js). It reads a list of account credentials, attempts to log into each one and extracts useful data for valid accounts. If the account level is 20 or higher, the script logs the account credentials into a local file.

## 📌 Features

- Automated login to https://panel.b-hood.ro
- Supports CSRF token handling and form submission
- Detects login errors, PIN requirement, and rate limiting
- Scrapes user profile data: Level & Faction Punish
- Saves valid accounts (level ≥ 20) to `valid.txt`
- Handles delays intelligently to avoid triggering bans
